        <h2>About Missile Man of India</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> 15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July
          2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th
          president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in
          Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
          engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and
          science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
          Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
          Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
          space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus
          came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the
          development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
          technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational,
          technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
          1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.

          Dr. Kalam played a crucial role in India's space and missile programs, notably leading the development of the
          country's first satellite launch vehicle (SLV-III) and the Agni and Prithvi missiles. His contributions to
          India's defense capabilities earned him the title of "Missile Man."

          Apart from his scientific achievements, Dr. Kalam was a beloved teacher and motivational speaker. He believed
          in the power of education and inspired millions of young minds with his vision for a developed and
          self-reliant India.

          On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at the Indian 
          Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort, but was able to
          enter the auditorium after a brief rest.[86] At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed.
          [87][88] He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any
          other signs of life.[87] Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac
          arrest at 7:45 p.m.
